F1-Score                     : 0.8700564971751412
Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) : 0.8749276812909632

Observations:
- The Random Forest model performs extremely well overall (â‰ˆ99.96% accuracy).
- High precision indicates the model rarely mislabels genuine transactions as fraud.
- Slightly lower recall shows some fraudulent cases may still be missed.
- The MCC value (~0.875) confirms strong balanced performance across classes.
- Future improvements could include class rebalancing (e.g., SMOTE) or tuning n_estimators.
